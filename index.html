    <p>
        If the world was divided into two -<br>
        One side will have all the answers to our questions<br>
        The other would have me and you,<br>
        Hustling against the waves <br>
        Streaming down the avalanches<br>
        Screaming from the edge of a mountain<br>
        My head on your shoulder <br>
        And sunset ahead <br>
        Supined on grass, stars overhead<br>
        Only if it's okay with you?<br>
        Only if you want me too...<br>
    </p>
    <h2>Love you always,<br>Shaurya</h2>
