        If the world was divided into two -
        One side will have all the answers to our questions
        The other would have me and you,
        Hustling against the waves 
        Streaming down the avalanches
        Screaming from the edge of a mountain
        My head on your shoulder 
        And sunset ahead
        Supined on grass, stars overhead
        Only if it's okay with you?
        Only if you want me too...
    </p>
    <h2>Love you always,<br>Shaurya ðŸ’«</h2>
